Super sales Dashboard using powerbi
In this project, I have created an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard using the SuperStore Sales dataset. The goal of this dashboard is to provide meaningful insights into sales performance across different regions, categories, and customer segments.

To build this dashboard, I followed a structured ETL process:

Used Power Query Editor to clean and transform the raw data as per analysis requirements.

Created calculated measures and columns using DAX to perform sales, profit, and quantity aggregations.

Once the data preparation was complete, I developed the dashboard using a variety of visuals such as cards, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and slicers. The layout is designed to be user-friendly and supports region-wise filtering for detailed insights.
####Key Insights from the Dashboard

Segment-wise and Payment Mode-wise sales distribution

Total KPIs: Sales, Quantity, and Profit for selected region
